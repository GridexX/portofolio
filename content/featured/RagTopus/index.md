RagTopus is a custom chatbot designed to help scientists to have a common platform to share their knowledge and collaborate on research projects.

It is built on top of [Open-WebUI](github.com/open-webui/open-webui) OpenStack and Terraform, and it is integrated with GitLab CI. The chatbot is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing scientists to add new features and functionalities as needed.
